# Astrix Event Page

- This web page is built using Reactjs and JavaScript.
- Reactjs helped in structuring the components and make them resuable for efficient rendring.
- I have used hooks like useState, useRef and useEffect hook.
- The whole folder is well structured and easy to navigate.
- All the designing and animation is done using core CSS.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
